Pi Wedge 40-Pin PreAssembled - Breakout For 40-Pin, Second Generation Raspberry Pi GPIO Connector.
----------------------------

_Additionally, please note that this is a new version, sold pre-assembled, using surface-mount components for machine assembly.  If you're looking for information about the PTH version sold as a kit, you want to see the[Pi Wedge B+ product Page](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12994)_

This is the Pi Wedge 40-Pin Pre Assembled, a board that connects to the second-generation Raspberry Pi 40-pin GPIO connector, and breaks the pins out to breadboard-friendly arrangement and spacing, and even adds a couple of decoupling capacitors on the power supply lines. The “Wedge” also makes the initial bringup process easier - you can plug an FTDI Basic module into the built-in serial port. This version comes pre-assembled, allowing you to prototype without any soldering.

The kit works Pi's that feature the 40-pin GPIO connector.  These are the [Pi 2 Model B](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13297), Pi 1 Model A+ and [Pi 1 Model B+](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12994) versions of the Raspberry Pi.

For the Model A and Model B, with the 26-pin GPIO connector, we also offer the regular [Pi Wedge](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12652) .

It adapts the GPIO header on a second-gen Pi to a standard solderless breadboard, such as our [meduim](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12002), [large](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/112) and [extra large](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12614) breadboards.  While it will technically with with a [mini](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12043) breadboard, it won't leave much room for external circuitry.
