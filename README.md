Pi Wedge B Plus PreAssembled - Breakout For Raspberry Pi B+ GPIO Connector
----------------------------

_Syntactic note: Guthub didn't like the '+' character in the name, so it's spelled out, instead._ 

_Additionally, please note that this is a new version, sold pre-assembled, using surface-mount components for machine assembly.  If you're looking for information about the PTH version sold as a kit, you want to see the[Pi Wedge B+ product Page](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12994)_

This is the Pi Wedge B Plus, a board that connects to the Raspberry Pi B+’s 40-pin GPIO connector, and breaks the pins out to breadboard-friendly arrangement and spacing, and even adds a couple of decoupling capacitors on the power supply lines. The “Wedge” also makes the initial bringup process easier - you can plug an FTDI Basic module into the built-in serial port. This version comes pre-assembled, allowing you to prototype without any soldering.

The kit works with both the Model A+ and [Model B+](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11546) versions of the Raspberry Pi.

For the Model A and Model B, we also offer the regular [Pi Wedge](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12652) 

It adapts the GPIO header on the B+ to a standard solderless breadboard, such as our [meduim](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12002), [large](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/112) and [extra large](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12614) breadboards.  While it will technically with with a [mini](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12043) breadboard, it won't leave much room for external circuitry.
